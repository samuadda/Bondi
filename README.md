# Bondi – Bootstrap Landing Page Practice

This is a front-end practice project built using **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **Font Awesome**, following the tutorials of **Osama Elzero** on YouTube.

The design is based on a fictional client called **Bondi**, a template from Graphberry.  
The main goal of this project was to practice Bootstrap’s grid system, utility classes, and responsive design.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project I focused on:

- Building a full landing page layout using **Bootstrap 4/5** (grid + containers + rows + cols)
- Using **utility classes** for spacing, alignment, and typography
- Creating a **responsive design** that works across different screen sizes
- Integrating **Font Awesome** for icons
- Structuring the page sections clearly (hero, services, portfolio, team, contact, footer, etc.)

This project represents an early step in my front-end journey, before moving into more advanced React/Next.js and SaaS apps.
