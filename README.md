# Bondi

This project is mainly focusing on the usage of Bootstrap, and I have used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons, following the instructions of [Osama Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mdGUKFu5OQ&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAyvm7f--dc6XqkpfDcen_vQ) on youtube.

the client is a fictional client called Bondi from [graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template), I have used Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes make this design responsive on all screens available live on [Github Pages](https://samuadda.github.io/Bondi/).
